		<h1>Pentagram Marks</h1>
		<p class="author">Posted by <a href="https://dbushell.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Visit the website of David Bushell">David Bushell</a></p>
		<p><strong>Pentagram Marks</strong> arrived in the post this week!</p>
<p>The book is delightfully smallish in stature at an estimated 7.5 x 6 inches and the 400 page depth adds enough weight that it feels important in your hand. The cover is double folded card with a matt finish in red. I'm not going to guess a Pantone but from an artistic point of view I can see hints of blue in there. Not to get too hung up on the red but it's obviously been carefully chosen.</p>
<p>The title is set in<strong> Pentagram's</strong> logo font which I believe is <em>AT Modern Twenty</em> after a few googles. The word "Marks" is printed in the slightly-blueish-red tinted slightly lighter and also subtlety debossed, which adds a bit of class.</p>
<p>The spine is perfectly minimalist, perfect bound, sans-serif, even the publishes logo looks good. The back cover is the pure red paper stock with a small white barcode sticker in the bottom right corner. This is also a nice touch.</p>
<p>With the exception of the single page introduction the 400 pages consist of a logo centre stage, and bottom right: <em>organisation </em>(bold), <em>year</em> [of design], <em>description of organisation</em>. The layout is simple and does the job. It's by no means a "classic" but it's not over-designed either. Simplicity in design is hard to master. There are no page numbers, any questionable necessity would not justify their overshadowing presence on the page. I can imagine hours of debate over the smallest layout decision. Either that, or knowing those crafty Pentagram partners they probably knocked it up in 2 hours (show offs!).</p>
<p>There are a couple of other interesting things to note. The logos are ordered alphabetically ascending by organisation name. I would have initially expected chronological order, but the more I think about it I'm beginning to agree with this choice. Logos should be timeless so suggesting "old" and "new" is unimportant. And now I realise exactly <em>why </em>this book doesn't need page numbers. You're only ever going to be referencing a particular logo from its name.</p>
<p>Another point of note is the lack of a "designer" attribute. We are therefore forced to see <strong>Pentagram </strong>as a single entity, and not a collective of ever changing partners.</p>
<p>The logos are presented in black and white:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isolating them in black and white helps us appreciate these marks as unique formal solutions, and highlights the contrasts and occasional similarities among them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To suggest that all 400 logos are classics of design would be rather silly. Some of the logos are downright awful. But then you flick past the <a title="Victoria &amp; Albert Museum" href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/">V&amp;A</a> logo you understand why Pentagram has published their own logo book. There are a few pleasant touches, such as Puffin Books and Penguin Books facing each other on facing pages. No sloppy editing here.</p>
<p>I should note this is a review of the mass print paperback version. The limited 1000 print edition is at least twice as lovely. Check out the <a title="Logo Design Love - Pentagram Marks" href="http://www.logodesignlove.com/pentagram-marks">Logo Design Love - Pentagram Marks</a> blog post to see it in full-colour photo glory.</p>
